# Pharmacy service

## Overview

This project is a WPF application (using C# and XAML) called "TechHealth" that serves as an information system for a hospital. Data is stored and managed using JSON files in a folder called "Json". Each student was primarily responsible for the design and functionality of one of the four applications for different users, following the specified specifications for each. There is a variation in the devices on which the application is used, as well as the user profiles for which it is primarily intended.

The project was developed by implementing SOLID principles, design patterns, and an MVVM architecture.

To test the application, the user can read some of the login data for each of the users in the Json folder.User types: doctor,patient,manager and secretary.

## Implementation

In the "class_diagram" folder, there are PowerDesigner files that can be used to open a use case diagram from the perspective of the four separate users of the application: patient, doctor, secretary, and manager.

In the "class_diagram" folder, there are the main class diagram, as well as sequence diagrams and activity diagrams.
